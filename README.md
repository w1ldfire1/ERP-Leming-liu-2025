### Abstract 
 
In recent years, the UK housing market has demonstrated notable nonlinear dynamics and structural changes, driven by a series of shocks including Brexit, the public health crisis, and a cycle of high inflation and interest rate hikes. Traditional econometric models, constrained by assumptions of linearity and stability, struggle to identify discontinuous changes in market conditions. The paper introduces a topological data analysis (TDA) framework, which is employed to construct a temporal trajectory of housing market structural complexity through multivariate and univariate embedding and sliding window persistent homology calculations. This study utilizes monthly data from London and Northwest England from 2009 to 2024 to investigate the disparities in uncertainty levels and shock response patterns between the two markets. London exhibits a phased-variable-dominated pattern, while the Northwest exhibits an overall synchronized response to national shocks. The findings indicate that the TDA persistent L‚ÇÅ norm can function as an effective forward-looking indicator for identifying structural changes in the housing market and provide a quantitative basis for designing differentiated regional policies.
